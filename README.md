It is finally here: The OWASP Auto Exam script !

During my last exam attempt I failed because my bad time management.
So I decided to speed things up and coded my whole methodology and thinking in one script.
As a thank you to the community I release it today.

Some questions and answeres:

Is this legal ?
Yes in the OffSec exam rules there is nothing against this script. While it contains <spoilers> it uses some loopholes and is AS of today totally legal to run during a exam.

Will it give me enough points to pass and I don't have to do anything ?
In theory yes, connect to the exam labs, run the script and watch the magic unfold. I can't guarantee that you will get your certification. There is a chance that you pass, but that is all depending on OffSec. They can change their lab setup at any time and this can change the parameters for the script. 

So is all your experience from the course in that script ?
Yes while I didn't create skynet, this script captures my mindset and methodology during a exam pretty good.












































































































































Btw: Happy Aprils Fool day to everbody in the Offsec World ;)
